# TODO LIST APPLICATION

Wanted to familiarize myself a little bit more with Node/Express so following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@purposenigeria/build-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-express-js-d7e59c7a3dfb) I was able to make an API for a todo list application.

I was also able to set up postgres thanks to [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/)
